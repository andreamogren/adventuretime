			<h1>About us<h1>
				<p>We are a group of four students from Hyper Island's Digital Data Strategist program. Our goal here is to provide a fun and interactive service for people living in or just passing by Stockholm. We are adventuring ourselves into the world of API's, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and JSON. This has been an intrepid journey for us and we truly hope this website results in a considerable flow on Google Analytics... so please help us spread the word about it!</p>

				<p class="personalinfo"><em>Andrea Mogren</em> worked on the JavaScript code, the HTML and a little bit of the CSS. She also structured the goals of the project. 
				   Andrea is a crazy dog lady who likes to write, read books and do yoga in her free time.</p>

				
				<p class="personalinfo"><em>Alex Ashman</em> is a Swedish fella that has insomnia and likes to code.</p>

				

				<p class="personalinfo"><em>Enny Hells√©n</em> is a happy Swedish girl who is the queen of CSS.</p>

				

				<p class="personalinfo"><em>Mahle Robin</em> is just a Brazilian/French guy who is trying to learn new skills after having decided not to be a chef anymore. He contributed mostly with the HTML and CSS parts, but he has also helped organizing the data showed on the website.</p>
