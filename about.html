			<h1>About us<h1>
				<p>We are a group of four students from Hyper Island's Digital Data Strategist program. Our goal here is to provide a fun and interactive service for people living in or just passing by Stockholm. We are adventuring ourselves into the world of API's, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and JSON. This has been an intrepid journey for us and we truly hope this website results in a considerable flow on Google Analytics... so please help us spread the word about it!</p>

				<p>Andrea Mogren is a Swedish girl that looks like Agnes from Fucking Åmål and says "yas" instead of "yes".</p>

				<p>Alex Ashman is a Swedish fella that has insomnia and likes to code.</p>

				<p>Enny Hellsén is a happy Swedish girl who is the queen of CSS.</p>

				<p>Mahle Robin is just a Brazilian/French guy who is trying not to be a chef anymore.</p>
